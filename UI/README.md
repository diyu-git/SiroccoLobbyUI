## Design Notes

Both screens feature:
- Dark underwater atmosphere
- Sirocco ships (shark-faced warship, red-sailed ship) in background
- Ornate naval frames with anchor and rope details
- Teal/cyan for Team 1, Orange for Team 2
- Consistent maritime aesthetic

Use these as visual targets when implementing the Unity UI.
